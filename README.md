# learning-sdl2-gridmap

I am learning SDL2 with C.

This repository contains a small SDL2 program that:
- Reads a grid of 0s and 1s from a file
- Renders the grid as a black-and-white map
- Allows a square to move on the grid
- Prevents movement into blocked (black) cells

This project is created purely for learning purposes.
